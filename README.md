Dependencies are described on my note book
TODOs
   - make git for the whole comp_chem_py structure
   - add ebsel as a submodule inside basis_count
   - add also line to bash for python_path and executable scripts
   - Make sure all scripts are protected by an if __name__ == '__main__': command
   - document everything with sphinx
   - link to read the docs
   - add tests (maybe...)
