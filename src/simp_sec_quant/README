simp_sec_quant: SIMPLIFICATOR FOR SECOND-QUANTIZATION EXPRESSIONS

The simp_sec_quant.py file contains a set of classes (objects) that allows 
to construct second quantization expressions with a Fock operator
and a fluctuation potential and spin-free molecular orbitals (closed-shell).

The created expressions are similar to the one derived in Chapter 13 
of the Molecular electronic structure theory book by Helgaker.

The expressions can then be simplified to expressions that can be implemented
in standard quantum chemistry packages.

To see examples of usage look into ${comp_chem_py}/tests/expressions.py

TODO: 
   - add triple and quadruple permutations
   - add inner product with doubly excited determinant
