This directory contains the script files required to run MTS in CPMD 
in combination with TURBOMOLE.

The EXT_HIGH_FORCES and EXT_LOW_FORCES files are the ones called by CPMD. 
   EXT_HIGH_FORCES would be called to get high level forces from TURBOMOLE.
   EXT_LOW_FORCES would be called to get low level forces from TURBOMOLE.

Every parameter that is specific to the current run is defined inside 
the EXT_***_FORCES scripts. Except the input file to the define program 
which is used to create the control file (input to TURBOMOLE).

The turbo_call script is then called and takes care of running TURBOMOLE
depending on the parameters set in the EXT_***_FORCES scripts.

If everything runs smoothly, turbo_call will produce a file with the 
nuclear forces that will be read by CPMD. 

Else a file EXT.error should be produced and tell CPMD to quit
with a meaningful error statement.
