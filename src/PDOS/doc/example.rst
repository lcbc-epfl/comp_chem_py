Example
-------

In the test directory of the PDOS repository, you can find a Gaussian output
file for the nitrogen molecule, ``N2.log`` as well as a file containing subset of 
atomic orbitals ``group_of_AOs.inp`` generated by the python script ``group_of_AOs``.
Those files can be used to test the calculation of PDOS using the ``PDOS`` script.
Proceed as follows, 

#. enter the test directory (from the root directory PDOS), ::

    cd test/

#. execute the program, ::

    PDOS N2.log group_of_AOs.inp
    Use default parameters for plot? y/n [y]:

#. accept the default settings by pressing enter. You should see the following run time prints, ::

    Number of basis functions   =  18
    Number of occupied orbitals =  7

    Gaussian convolution of data...
    xmax =  66.578307481  [eV]
    xmin =  -395.511603391  [eV]
    npts =  46208
    FWHM =  1.0
    norm =  0.9394372787
    alpha =  2.77258872224
    
    Convolution of data done!

#. Finally, a window should pop up containing a graph of the DOS and PDOS of the nitrogen molecule.
  By zooming on the HOMO-LUMO gap region you should see a similar plot as the one in the test 
  directory denoted ``N2_PDOS.png``. This figure has been produced by gathering the AOs with sigma 
  symmetry under the green curve (s and pz AOs) while the blue figure represent the pi orbitals 
  (py and pz AOs).
